##Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in Audio Classifications

Audio classification has become a crucial component in various applications, such as voice recognition, music genre classification, and environmental sound detection. We are using various techniques to investigate the interpretability of the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a cutting-edge model for audio categorization.
